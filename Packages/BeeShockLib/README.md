# Exporting code from this module

The only code in this module that can be exported to other projects are the following:
- ImgManipulator.projective_transform
- ImgManipulator.crop
- ImgManipulator.add_bounding_boxes
- ImgManipulator.linear_interpolation

Everything else will not work since they are hardcoded to work specifically for the bee shock project.
